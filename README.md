# AI-Based-Resume-Screening-Ranking-System

### Introduction

* The recruitment process is a crucial aspect of human resource management, and with the increasing number of job applicants, automating resume screening has become essential. Traditional hiring methods require 
  recruiters to manually evaluate resumes, which is time-consuming and prone to human bias. To address these challenges, AI-driven resume screening systems have gained significant attention.
* The AI Resume Screening & Ranking System utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate resume evaluation, extract relevant information, and rank candidates based on their skills 
  and experience. By leveraging advanced data processing techniques, this system enhances the efficiency of recruiters, reduces hiring time, and ensures fair candidate assessment.
* This project aims to develop an intelligent resume screening system that provides accurate and unbiased resume analysis, helping recruiters make informed decisions efficiently.

### Abstract
* The AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System is a web-based solution designed to automate the process of resume evaluation and provide personalized recommendations for job seekers. By utilizing AI 
  algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system analyzes resumes uploaded by candidates, extracting key information such as contact details, skills, experience level, and other essential data. Based 
  on this analysis, the system suggests suitable career fields (e.g., Data Science, Web Development, Android Development) aligned with the candidate's expertise. 
* The system further enhances the candidate's profile by offering skill recommendations to improve job prospects and providing suggestions for relevant online courses. Additionally, it evaluates the quality of the 
  resume, assigning a resume score based on the inclusion of essential sections such as Objective, Achievements, Projects, and Hobbies. Candidates are also provided with resume writing tips and interview 
  preparation videos to boost their chances of landing a job. 
* For the Admin side, the system integrates with a MySQL database to store candidate data. Admin users can view and analyze candidate profiles, generate reports, and visualize trends, such as the most common 
  predicted job fields and experience levels, through pie charts. 
* This project leverages AI, NLP, and data analytics to streamline the hiring process, making it more efficient for recruiters and offering valuable insights for job seekers. Ultimately, the system helps both 
  candidates and recruiters achieve better job matching and improved hiring outcomes.

### System Design
Provide a system architecture diagram to represent the overall workflow of the project. 

The diagram should depict: 
1. User Interface (Streamlit) 
  * Users can upload their resumes (PDF).
  * Admins can manage data and view analytics. 
2. Resume Parsing & Processing 
   * pdfminer3 extracts text from resumes.
   * pyresparser analyzes resume content.
   * NLTK and spaCy process text data. 
3. Skill & Job Recommendation 
   * Keywords are matched with predefined job roles.
   * Recommended skills and courses are suggested. 
4. Database (MySQL) 
   * User data is stored (name, email, resume score, recommendations).
   * Admins can access and analyze the database. 
5. Visualization & Reporting 
   * Plotly generates charts.
   * Reports can be downloaded in CSV format. 
6. External Integrations 
   * yt_dlp fetches YouTube videos for career guidance.
   * AI-driven recommendations are displayed.
